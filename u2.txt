Biased & Bias-Corrected wavelet power spectrum for timeseries between dates 2013-10-20 / 2013-11-10 and wavelet coherence between f0F2 vs. HMXF & f0F2 vs. aTEC & HMXF vs. aTEC timeseries over 7281 samples * dt (dt = 4 minutes, time span between observations). Color scale represents coherency while the arrows represent the positive or negative coherency between the timeseries that are subjected to analysis. Arrows indicate the phase behaviour of the timeseries: in phase (pointing right), out of phase (pointing left); first ratio leading (down), second ratio leading (up). The interpretation of the results is coming soon.
