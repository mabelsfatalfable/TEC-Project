24 May 2014 6.9 Mw 09:25:03 UTC Aegean Sea Earthquake
The disturbance which was generated by the earthquake occured within Aegean Sea is clearly shown in the F layer critical frequency (f0F2) and height of maximum plasma frequency (HMXF) wavelet power spectrum. Plot includes the monthly (for May 2014) f0F2 & HMXF timeseries (11156 samples are observed for 4 minutes of intervals between without NA array elements for 31 days in total).
Observation no:#8418 indicates time 09:24:04 in UTC @24.05.2014.
Also the f0F2 & HMXFwavelet power spectrum has been plotted to compare before/after the event whether they are disturbed or not.
The maximum power (the red on color & the white on black-white densest area in plots) around period value of around 360 number of samples which represents 360*4 minutes ~ around 24 hours is from the main f0F2 daily oscillation. Other than that there is an also a wave-like oscillation around 180 samples which is quite around 12 hours that is due to the day-night shifts of the total electron content which can be determined and derived from the f0F2-aTEC wavelet coherence plots.
